          <p class="fw-bold">1. Difference between var, let and const.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues
            associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it
            was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. Scope
            essentially means where these variables are available for use. var
            declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The
            scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
            This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a
            function block is available for use in the whole window.<br /><br />
            Let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as
            it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the
            problem with var. A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block
            lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a
            variable declared in a block with let is only available for use
            within that block.<br /><br />
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. Const
            declarations share some similarities with let declarations. Like let
            declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the
            block they were declared. This means that the value of a variable
            declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be
            updated or re-declared.

            2. Difference between arrow function and regular function.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
            introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function
            expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow
            functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences
            between them. <br />
            Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have
            access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent
            function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to
            capture the arguments passed to arrow functions. <br />
            Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own
            this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same
            throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the
            value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function. <br /><br />
            Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions
            are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are
            constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However,
            the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e
            arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence,
            they can never be invoked with the new keyword. <br />
            Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether
            in strict or non-strict mode. With arrow functions, duplicate named
            arguments are always, regardless of strict or non-strict mode,
            invalid.

            3. Difference between map, forEach, filter and find.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array
            element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array.
            map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does
            not change the original array. <br />
            <br />
            The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.
            The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.forEach()
            calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an
            array in ascending index order. It is not invoked for index
            properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized.
            <br /><br />
            The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that
            pass a test provided by a function. The filter() method does not
            execute the function for empty elements. The filter() method does
            not change the original array. <br /><br />
            The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes
            a test. The find() method executes a function for each array
            element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are
            found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty
            elements. The find() method does not change the original array.

          <p class="fw-bold">4. Why template string is used?</p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`)
            characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
            interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs
            called tagged templates. Template literals are sometimes informally
            called template strings, because they are used most commonly for
            string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of
            placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in
            a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform
            whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template
            literal. <br />
            <br />
            emplate literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of
            double or single quotes. Along with having normal strings, template
            literals can also contain other parts called placeholders, which are
            embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces:
            ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function
            — either a default function, or a function you supply. The default
            function (when you don't supply your own) just performs string
            interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then
            concatenate the parts into a single string. To supply a function of
            your own, precede the template literal with a function name; the
            result is called a tagged template. In that case, the template
            literal is passed to your tag function, where you can then perform
            whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template
            literal. To escape a backtick in a template literal, put a backslash
            (\) before the backtick.
